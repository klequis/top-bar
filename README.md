# Top Bar
A React responsive navigation component

My first try at creating a reusable and configurable React component. Suggestions and advice welcome.

## About
- Isn't wrapped-up for easy reuse but could end-up that way. Contributions welcome
- Spans top of page
- Displays hamburger menu on phone
- Uses react-responsive
- Currently a Bootswatch theme is baked-in

## Configuration
- see topbar.config.js
